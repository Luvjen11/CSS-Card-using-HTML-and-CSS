                <h3>Nigeria</h3>
                <p>Nigeria, often referred to as the "Giant of Africa," for me, it holds a special place in my heart since it's where my roots trace back to. 
                    I like exploring Igbo's culture, music and traditions. 
                    I lived there for two years and I remember how fun and peaceful it was.</p>

                <h3>Italy</h3>
                <p>Italy, the birthplace of Renaissance art, Roman architecture, and mouthwatering cuisine. 
                    It's where I was born and currently living. I had most of my first experiences and memories in this Country I'm proud of being part.</p>

                <p>South Korea, a dynamic blend of ancient traditions and modern innovations. 
                    I feel in love with the music, K-dramas, fashion, culture and traditions of this Country. I hope someday to be able to visit it.</p>
